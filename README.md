 A C++ game engine implemented by Artem Kovalovs, additional features implemented by me as homework and projects

## Milestone: Particle System

### 1. Basic Particle System
In milestone 1, I created a basic particle system where particles emit towards world y direction

### 2. Fire Simulation
In milestone2, I simulated a fire effect based on this basic particle system

### 3. Fire Simulation with Wind 
The milestone3 focuses on simulating a realistic fire effect with interactive wind control. Players can
 adjust the wind strength using keyboard input, influencing the fire's behavior
